  <h1 align="center"><strong>seafile-mount</strong></h1>

  <p align="center">
    Mount your <a href="https://www.seafile.com/en/home/">Seafile</a> libraries, but containerized.
  </p>

## About

This docker image mounts a [Seafile](https://www.seafile.com/en/home/) user's library using the [seadrive](https://help.seafile.com/drive_client/drive_client_for_linux/) client, which streams a filesystem instead of syncing the while instance.

Using Seadrive containerized has several advantages (probably â€“ in my case, it was just an infrastructural requirement).

Image supports, x86_64 and arm64 because that's what Seadrive is available for. Albeit, the arm64 Debian repository for Seadrive didn't receive the latest patches, but still works.


## Drawbacks

Your **host** system needs to have [Fuse](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse) installed and the container needs to be run with `--privileged`.

## Running it

* Configure using [environment variables](#environment-variables).
* Give extended privileges ([Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities), [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/05-services/#privileged))
* [Bind mount](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/#use-a-bind-mount-with-compose) `/seafile` with type `bind` and bind-propagation `rshared`.
* Image is just called `seafile-mount`

### Example

```sh
docker run --privileged \
--env-file ./.env \
--mount type=bind,source=/home/yuri/seafile-mount,target=/seafile,bind-propagation=rshared \
-it seafile-mount
```

See
the [official documentation](https://help.seafile.com/drive_client/drive_client_for_linux/#running-seadrive-without-gui)
for more info about these options.<br/>
<sub>"Info" in this case means there isn't much info in the official documentation anyway.</sub>

### Acquiring a Token

As shown in the [official documentation](https://help.seafile.com/drive_client/drive_client_for_linux/#running-seadrive-without-gui), request a token from your Seafile instance's API.

```sh
curl --url https://YOUR_SEAFILE_INSTANCE/api2/auth-token/ \
  --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data-urlencode "username=EMAIL" \
  --data-urlencode "password=PASSWORD"
```

Note that it doesn't work with a Token extracted from a browser session.
